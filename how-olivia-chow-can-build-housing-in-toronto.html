Fast-tracking housing applications must only be the first step for the mayor-elect when she’s sworn in on July 12.</p><p>To truly tackle the housing supply crisis, there’s Herculean work ahead to scrub the anti-rental philosophy that has dominated city hall for a generation and open the door to a pro-growth vision for Toronto’s future.</p><p>Over the past decade, the number of rental households in Toronto has grown <a class="text-block__link" oncontextmenu="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.bildgta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Purpose-Built-Rental-Whitepaper-FINAL.pdf">three times faster</a> than ownership households, while the supply of Purpose-Built Rentals (PBRs) has grown by only <a class="text-block__link" oncontextmenu="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.bildgta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Purpose-Built-Rental-Whitepaper-FINAL.pdf">5 per cent</a>. Almost 90 per cent of PBRs in the GTA were built over 40 years ago — before millennials were even born.</p><p>This should come at no surprise to councillors. They’ve gradually accumulated an overwhelming schedule of development charges and regulatory burdens atop PBRs, an approach more resemblant of sin taxes than a housing strategy. Combined with lethargic approval timelines and absurd design guidelines, these units are exceptionally difficult to build.</p><p>Municipal <a class="text-block__link" oncontextmenu="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2022/07/cmhc-report-government-fees-crippling-housing-construction">development charges</a> are lowest for single family homes (about $35 per square foot), rising to $70 for row houses, $100 for condos and highrise rentals and peaking at $110 for lowrise rentals. In Toronto, PBRs take on average <em>100 months</em> to complete — over 8 years — and at the end of 2022, only <a class="text-block__link" oncontextmenu="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.bildgta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Purpose-Built-Rental-Whitepaper-FINAL.pdf">one-third</a> of proposed<strong> </strong>rental projects were approved.</p><p>A recent <a class="text-block__link" oncontextmenu="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://cibccm.com/en/insights/articles/the-week-ahead-time-to-waive-or-defer-hst-on-purpose-built-rentals/">report</a> from CIBC’s Benjamin Tal found developing a 400-unit condo earns a 12.5 per cent return on average, but that same sized development as a PBR would yield a 20 per cent <em>loss.</em></p><p><span id="contentMiddleBreakPoint"></span></p><p>Urbanation <a class="text-block__link" oncontextmenu="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" onclick="theStarLinkClick(event, this)" href="https://www.bildgta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Purpose-Built-Rental-Whitepaper-FINAL.pdf">estimates</a> Toronto needs more than 300,000 new PBRs in the next decade at the low end, for which we’re well off track. Chow’s platform called for a major role for CreateTO to develop social and market housing.</p><p>While this is a welcome ambition, we cannot alone rely on government agencies and public-private partnerships to build things. Look at Housing Now, which has yet to break ground on any of its sites.</p><p>As Mark Richardson from HousingNowTO explained, the City treated “the actual successful delivery of new affordable rental housing units … as an afterthought, as a ‘nice to have,’ as a generally low-priority within the myriad of overlapping and conflicting City Planning priorities and guidelines that exist within City Hall.”<br><br>On the campaign trail and in post-election media hits, Chow has increasingly embraced the leading role that private developers will have to play in tackling the shortage. Attracting investor capital for the housing type Torontonians most desperately need — rentals — requires fundamental reform of the PBR development regime.<br><br>As a coalition builder, Chow can unlock a multi-partisan super-consensus on housing between all levels of government, with new rentals at its heart.<br><br>She should make building rentals more attractive to the private market by reducing development charges for low- and highrise projects, waiving application fees and parkland dedication fees; accelerating permitting timelines by prioritizing PBR applications; increasing height and density limits, especially on smaller lots, and allowing modular construction for highrise PBRs. While Chow has expressed reluctance for strong mayor powers, this authority is well-suited to spur a new generation of private PBR construction in Toronto.<br><br>She will find a welcome ally in Premier Doug Ford’s government, which has already introduced reductions and deferrals on development charges for PBRs, with a higher discount for family-sized units. Together with the province, Chow can lead the charge to call on the federal government to waive or defer HST payments on new PBRs, and lower premiums on rental loan insurance programs — counterproductively raised by the CMHC in April.<br><br>Toronto’s political battle lines are no longer between conservative or progressive values — it’s a contest between growth or stagnation. Mayor-elect Chow has framed her career on connecting with immigrants, young people, and the working class. Now she has an opportunity to ensure they have a home in our city’s future.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 5, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://al-kivi.github.io/gh-pages/tags/housing/">housing</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://al-kivi.github.io/gh-pages/authors/al-kivi/" class="invert" rel="author">Al Kivi</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Sed varius enim lorem ullamcorper dolore aliquam aenean ornare velit lacus,ac varius enim lorem ullamcorper dolore.
